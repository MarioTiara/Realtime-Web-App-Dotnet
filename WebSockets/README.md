# REALTIME APPLICATION - WEBSOCKT

The  [WebSocket API ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

In this repository, I crated a project that implement websocket using dotnet as a Websocket server and a simple javascript as the client. This project explore several features in websocket which are:
1. Connect and Disconnect a client 
2. Getting and Id from server
4. Brodcast message
5. Private message based on Id
